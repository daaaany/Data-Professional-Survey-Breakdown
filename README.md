# Data Professional Survey Breakdown
***
I want to start this post by showing gratitude to Alex Freberg for all the guidance through his youtube videos and for presenting every topic in a very simple and unique way.

Here's my first [interactive dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWY1YzI2YmMtNzYyMy00OGQ0LTlhYzktYWRhM2JlZTBkNDg2IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9) here, made on Microsoft Power BI Desktop, but before jumping to the visualization part, we cleaned data using Power Query Editor.

**Here are the steps I took to clean our data:**
* Removed unnecessary columns
* Cleaned some columns by splitting using a delimiter, replacing values, and changing data types
* Added new custom columns

**Throughout this project, I was able to apply my knowledge and skills of:**
* Dataanalysis
* Data Interpretation
* Data Cleaning
* Graphs and Charts
* Data Visualization
* Analysis and Insights

During this project, first I used Power Query Editor to do Data Manipulation and clean up required for the data visualization and then Power BI Visualization tool to create an impactful and visually appealing report, which will help us to understand survey data better (Survey data was also collected by Alex Freberg).

**Insights that we got from this are:**
* Average age of respondents is 30 years
* Data Scientists have the highest salary followed by Data Engineer and Data Analysts
* Favourite programming language of the majority of respondents is Python
* We've got the most responses from the United States
* It was neither easy nor difficult for the majority of respondents to break into IT (have to do an ample amount of hard work to break into the IT industry)
* On a scale of 0-10, the average rating of a happy work-life balance is 5.7 (more people can balance their life along with work)
* On a scale of 0-10, the average rating of a happy with salary balance is 4.3 (respondents are expecting more compensation)

Do let me know if you've any feedback or suggestions and how I can improve this on the go.
